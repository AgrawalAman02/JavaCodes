Leetcode 99:
    You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST),
    where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake.
    Recover the tree without changing its structure.
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
Example 2:
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
